Part E - For Extra Credit (10%)  (5 / 10)
-----------------------------
Extra credit for design :)
For me is very important to be able to use the program comfortably.
I'm user-orientated developer! And I agree that the functionality and efficiency is much more important,
but I spent only around 40 min to adjust this menus from my previous assessment


Part F - Reflection (8 / 8)
-----------------------------
Filled out parts A - D above (3 / 3)

Rest(5 / 5)
Firstly I started with the menus just because for me it's easier to see and visualise what I have to do.
Then I typed all Structure from the overview on tutors (created all classess with all their methods and variables)
Then adjusted all my table styles using test planet.
Set up the .xml save() and load() to be able to work with bigger list of planets
Managed to push it to GitHub (you can see all progress there if you want on request)
https://github.com/KorneAlex/OleksandrKorniienko_big_assessment_2_java.git
and started working on methods one by one.

Main difficulties I came across in your development of solution and how I solved them.
The biggest issue for me was and still is, is the update class. by it self it works but when i try to use it from the Driver with other methods,
it just doesn't work. Unfortunatelly I'm out of time and mental health to finish it before the deadline. I hope to get feedback on that method.
Any help wold be much appreciated.


Main learnings from my engagement with assignment
Learned different way to create menus
Practices/remembered the sort and search methods
Learned about abstract class, inheritance and interfaces

Mandatory : PLease list any references used in your development/ implementation of your submission:
All I used was lectures and labs. Didn't need to look for other information.

Please consider the following statements and choose one (delete the inappropriate one)

- This is my work apart from the specific references noted above (and any code from class notes). I understand the code and can decribe any parts of the solution if needs be;

Total: 24+25+19+10+5+3+5=91 (fells like 85)
